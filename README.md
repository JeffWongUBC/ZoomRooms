Code Snippets for Zoom Rooms Native Controls used by me

I will generally try to name the JSON files by {protocol}_{device}.json

If it's a full room example they will be placed in their own subfolder with all dependencies.

Code for specific devices will also be in their own subfolder.

If you have any comments or improvements please let me know.
